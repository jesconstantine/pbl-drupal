#### Description
The Product Feature paragraph is a simple way to call attention to Akamai's products and their features. It has a space for a custom code embed that spans the full width of the page when there is not a rail navigation. Many of its fields are optional for flexibility. There is a right variant that switches the text to the right side of the embed. Additionally, there is a full-width variant of the product feature which does not have any additional text.
