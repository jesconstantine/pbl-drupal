#### Description
The inline image component accepts an image and an optional caption. It allows you to insert images into your WYSIWYG content as you need them. There are four layout options. The default option is left-aligned. There are also: full-width (which means the image will take up the full width of the space you place it into) and left-aligned and right-aligned variants, which are 50% wide.
