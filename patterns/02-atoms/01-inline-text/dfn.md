title: 'Text Attribute: Definition'
---
#### Description
The HTML Definition element is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The p element, the dt/dd pairing, or the section element which is the nearest ancestor of the dfn is considered to be the definition of the term.

It's worth noting that functionally, there is very little that the dfn element does for you; its main purpose is in providing an established form of semantic markup to use for marking terms. You could just as well use a custom class on span elements and not really lose much or any functionality.
