title: 'Text Attribute: Bidirectional Isolation'
---
#### Description
The HTML Bidirectional Isolation element contains text which may be rendered using a different text direction than the surrounding text. This lets you, for example, present a quote in Arabic (which is written right-to-left) within a paragraph written in English (written left-to-right). The user agent should correctly detect that the text within the bdi element should be rendered right-to-left and adjust accordingly.
