title: 'Definition Term item'

#### Description
The HTML dt element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a dl element. It is usually followed by a dd element; however, multiple dt elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next dd element.

The subsequent dd (Description Details) element provides the definition or other related text associated with the term specified using dt.
