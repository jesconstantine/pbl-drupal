title: 'Time Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type time create input fields designed to let the user easily enter a time (hours and minutes, and optionally seconds).

The control's user interface will vary from browser to browser. Support is good in modern browsers, with Safari being the sole major browser not yet implementing it; in Safari, and any other browsers that don't support time, it degrades gracefully to input type="text".
