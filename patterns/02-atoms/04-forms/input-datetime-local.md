title: 'Datetime Local Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type datetime-local create input controls that let the user easily enter both a date and a time, including the year, month, and day as well as the time in hours and minutes. The user's local time zone is used. The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser; at the moment support is patchy, with only Chrome/Opera and Edge on desktop and most modern versions of mobile browsers having usable implementations. In other browsers, these degrade gracefully to simple input type="text" controls.
