title: 'Email Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type "email" are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of email addresses. The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted email address (or list of addresses) before the form can be submitted. The :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate.
