title: 'Tel Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type "tel" are used to let the user enter and edit a telephone number. Unlike input type="email" and input type="url", the input value is not automatically validated to a particular format before the form can be submitted, because formats for telephone numbers vary so much around the world.

Despite the fact that inputs of type tel are functionally identical to standard text inputs, they do serve useful purposes; the most quickly apparent of these is that mobile browsers — especially on mobile phones — may opt to present a custom keypad optimized for entering phone numbers. Using a specific input type for telephone numbers also makes adding custom validation and handling of phone numbers more convenient.
