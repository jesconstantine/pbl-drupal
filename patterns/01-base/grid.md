#### Description
Bootstrap’s grid system is a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

It uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.
