#### Description
The HTML button element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms, or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality. By default, HTML buttons are typically presented in a style similar to that of the host platform the user agent is running on, but you can change the appearance of the button using CSS.
