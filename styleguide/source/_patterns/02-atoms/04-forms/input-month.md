title: 'Month Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type month create input fields that let the user enter a month and year allowing a month and year to be easily entered. The value is a string whose value is in the format "YYYY-MM", where YYYY is the four-digit year and MM is the month number.

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser; at the moment support is patchy, with only Chrome/Opera and Edge on desktop — and most modern mobile browser versions — having usable implementations. In browsers that don't support month inputs, the control degrades gracefully to a simple input type="text", although there may be automatic validation of the entered text to ensure it's formatted as expected.
