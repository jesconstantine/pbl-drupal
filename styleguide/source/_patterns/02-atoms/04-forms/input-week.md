title: 'Week Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type "week" create input fields allowing easy entry of a year plus the ISO 8601 week number during that year (i.e., week 1 to 52 or 53).

The control's user interface varies from browser to browser; cross-browser support is currently a bit limited, with only Chrome/Opera and Microsoft Edge supporting it at this time. In non-supporting browsers, the control degrades gracefully to function identically to input type="text".
