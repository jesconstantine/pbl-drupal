title: 'Date Input'
---
#### Description
input elements of type date create input fields that let the user enter a date, either using a text box that automatically validates the content, or using a special date picker interface. The resulting value includes the year, month, and day, but not the time. The time and datetime-local input types support time and date/time inputs.

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser; at the moment support is patchy, see Browser compatibility for further details. In unsupported browsers, the control degrades gracefully to a simple input type="text".
