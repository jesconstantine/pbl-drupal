title: Horizontal Rule
---
#### Description
The HTML hr element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements; historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms
