title: 'Text Attribute: Keyboard Input'
---
#### Description
The HTML Keyboard Input element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a kbd element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

kbd may be nested in various combinations with the samp (Sample Output) element to represent various forms of input or input based on visual cues.
