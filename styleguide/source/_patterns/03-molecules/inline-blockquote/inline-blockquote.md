title: 'Inline blockquote'
---
#### Description
The HTML blockquote element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the cite element.

The inline blockquote component accepts a quote. It allows you to insert stylized quotes into your WYSIWYG content as you need them. There are three layout options. The default option is left-aligned. There is also a full-width (which means the blockquote will take up the full width of the space you place it into) and right floated variant.
